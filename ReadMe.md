## Web Hosting & Domain Explanation

### Domain Name
A domain name is a human-readable address that points to a website's IP address (a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network). For example:
- **Example Domain**: `princsam.dev` or `princsam.com`
- **Purpose**: Makes it easy for people to find and remember your website

### GitHub Pages Hosting
GitHub Pages is a free hosting service provided by GitHub that allows you to host static websites directly from a GitHub repository.
